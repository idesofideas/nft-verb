[OpenSea](opensea.io) is one of the first and surviving digital file brokers on the internet.

     //Consider [ascribe.io](ascribe.io) as a precursor//

With **≈ 6400**^1 ₿ in sales thus far generated, they are the pre-imminent clearinghouse for all things non-fungible in the burgeoning space.

Many Web3 wallets are now applicable to use with OpenSea participation, whether creating, selling, reselling, and/or buying.

They possess an above-average resource repository for interested individuals with a curiosity for more in-depth acumen to the technology behind NFT's, namely ERC-721, ERC-20, & ERC-1155 protocols.

Recently, they added an [NFT Bible](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/) doc that provides a thorough 101 on all you need to know about the smart-contract _de jure._

Extensive tutorials exist on how to build tokens and contracts.*

**NOTES:**

If you want to buy Ether to pay for to fill up your MetaMask Wallet, neither the portals MoonPay nor Wyre will accept Debit Bank cards, only Visa/Mastercard Credit.

Currently, (April 2021) there is a one-time Gas fee to complete the transaction. (est. $50 USD). After which, the Web3 wallet that made the GAS transaction will be authorized to sell on OpenSea without any further costs.

\*Of course, many of the tutorials possess the teleology that you direct your builds into the OpenSea ecosystem, which owns a custodial database which ultimately houses all of the digital NFT assets with no escape velocity to other ownership.

See this succinct recent Medium article about the topic. _(Author holds no position in Topps or Wax, though, is a IPFS developer and advocate)_
